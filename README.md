# Enhanced-road-accident-alerting-system
"Enhanced Road Accident Alerting System using ESP32 and Li-Fi Technology" aims to revolutionize how road accidents are detected and communicated, enhancing road safety by providing real-time accident alerts to emergency services and nearby vehicles.
Real-Time Accident Detection: Uses onboard sensors (e.g., Accelerometer/Gyroscope like MPU6050) to detect sudden impacts or rollovers characteristic of a road accident.
Rapid Alert Transmission: Utilizes Li-Fi for instantaneous, short-range, line-of-sight communication to a nearby base station (e.g., a street light or road-side unit) upon accident detection.
GPS/Location Reporting: Integrated GPS module (or pre-configured location data for stationary units) to pinpoint the exact location of the incident.
